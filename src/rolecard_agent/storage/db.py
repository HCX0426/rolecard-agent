"""SQLite connection helpers + schema bootstrap.

Bootstrap order is fixed and not optional:
  1. core/schema.sql        tenant / app_user / session_thread / plugin / audit_log
  2. roles/schema.sql       role_card
  3. domains/<x>/schema.sql for each ENABLED plugin, in DOMAINS order

Step 1 must run first: domains reference app_user(user_id).

Every connection MUST enable `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` - SQLite ignores foreign keys by
default, which would silently turn the ON DELETE CASCADE in domains/health/schema.sql into
a no-op and leave orphaned index rows behind.
